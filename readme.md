# IT Programming

## Activities-Section

Weclome to IT Programming repo in GitHub.

#### A-We have two activities in this repo as following :
- Python
- HTML/CSS

#### B-In each folder we have many sub folders for each exercise.
- Each exercise has two steps at least.
- Each step has one or more instruction.
- Each instruction has one point or more.

#### C-In each sub folder there is a readme file which has four basic topics:
- Goals
- Steps
- Hints
- Tutorials

#### Let's talk about the challenging part:

We have two kinds of activities python and html/css, each one of them has many exercises for each exercise at least two steps with one or more instruction for each one.
We give each instruction one point or more, then each step has the sum of instruction points, the exercise points there are the sum of steps, finaly the activity will be the sum of exercises.

How about imagine the activities as a game!
The game wil be between many schools ,as a school it is represinting a class of many students, in each school we have many teams, each team has at least two students.
During the year the students will do the exercises and the teacher will calculate the points for each exercise considering the rules.
In the end of the year the school who has the highest score will win!

It is a game so it needs rules, let's add some rules to make it more chalenge!

We have here three kinds of score for each exercise:
- IS: it is an individual score for each student (the sum of points for each exercise)
- TS: it is a team score for each team in the class(the sum of individual scores for each team)
- CS:it is a class score for each class (the sum of team scores for each class)

And the rules for each exercise are:
##### As a class:
  - **The full exercise** should be submitted by all teams on a deadline specified by the teacher.
  - If not the the class score will be half of team scores.

##### As a team:
  - **The full exercise** should be submitted by all team members on a deadline specified by the teacher.
  - If not the the team score will be half of personal scores
  
##### As individually:
  - **The full exercise** should be submitted by the student on a deadline specified by the teacher.
  - If not the the individual score will be half of the points were done by the student.

Let's collect some points!
