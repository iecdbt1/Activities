# IT Programming

## Activities-Section

Weclome to IT Programming repo in GitHub.

#### A- We have two activities in this repo as following :
- Python
- HTML/CSS

#### B- In each folder we have many sub folders for each exercise:
- Each exercise has two steps at least.
- Each step has one or more instruction.
- Each instruction has one point or more.

#### C- In each sub folder there is a readme file which has four basic topics:
- Goals
- Steps
- Hints
- Tutorials

#### Let's talk about the challenging part:

We have two kinds of activities python and html/css, each one of them has many exercises for each exercise at least two steps with one or more instruction for each one.
We give each instruction one point or more, then each step has the sum of instruction points, the exercise points there are the sum of steps, finaly the activity will be the sum of exercises.

How about imagine this activities as a Competition!
The Competition wil be between many schools ,as a school it is represinting a class of many students, in each school we have many teams, each team has at least two students.
During the year the students will do the exercises and the teacher will calculate the points for each exercise considering the rules.
In the end of the year the school who has the highest score will win!

It is a Competition so it needs rules, let's add some rules to make it more chalenge!

##### *We have here three kinds of score for each exercise:*
- **IS**: it is an individual score for each student (the sum of points for each exercise)
- **TS**: it is a team score for each team in the class(the sum of individual scores for each team)
- **CS**: it is a class score for each class (the sum of team scores for each class)

And the rules for each exercise are:
##### As individually:
  - **The full exercise** should be submitted by the student on a deadline specified by the teacher.
  - If not the the individual score will be half of the points were done by the student.
  
##### As a team:
  - **The full exercise** should be submitted by all team members on a deadline specified by the teacher.
  - If not the the team score will be half of the personal scores for team members.
  
##### As a class:
  - **The full exercise** should be submitted by all teams on a deadline specified by the teacher.
  - If not the the class score for this exersise will be half of the team scores for the class members.

##### General rules:
  - The deadlins should specify by the teacher.
  - During the activity each student allow to ask one question for the teacher.
  - During the activity the students allow to ask each other as much as they want.
  - During the activity the students allow to ask on discord private or general as much as they want.
  - Question is a question, if you ask what is "Hello" mean in arabic that consider as a question.
  
Now before starting the Competition I will give you some hints will help you to win the Competition:
  - This Competition it is not Individual Competition.
  - Focus on dividing the tasks between you and your colleagues in a way that each one of them part of the Competition.
  - In each task you find your self stuck, ***just copy the task and google it*** [Google](https://www.google.com/)
  - As a student you have just one question share it with your class before you ask it, maybe someone knows the solution so       you do not lose the chance to ask.
  - Unfortunately your colleagues do not have the answer, make sure that no one from your colleagues has the same question,       otherwise both of you will ask the same question and both of you not able to ask till the deadline. 
  - Congrats your team done the exercise before the deadline, but your job as a team in a class with many teams is not done       yet, you have to help the rest to finish the exercise before the deadline, otherwise your points will count as a half.
  - Finaly google as much as you can and do not forget to **read and read and read and read....**.
  
Let's collect some points!
